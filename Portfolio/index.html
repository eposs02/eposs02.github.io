    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I am currently a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder.  
        I am a Public Relations student and I'm minoring in Creative Technology 
        and Design. I'm from Colorado so I've lived here almost my whole life and 
        have learned to love the outdoors, I find them to be a good source of 
        inspiration. I have always been creative and my minor in CTD has allowed 
        me to explore that through graphic design along with various other forms of 
        creative media. I have grown as a writer throughout my time at CU and have 
        also learned how to think strategically which I believe is a skill that will 
        allow me to excel in various areas of life.  I am skilled in Adobe Creative 
        Cloud, HTML and CSS code, Microsoft Suite, Google Ads, and am familiar with 
        writing Press Releases, News Releases, Fact Sheets, and other aspects that may 
        be included in a media kit, all in AP style.</p>
