    <p>I have taken a class where I used html and css to create websites before and I wasn't great at it. 
        My goal for this class is to be comfortable with coding language. I'm from Denver. I transfered 
        freshman year from Miami of Ohio, where I took a class similar to this. I love to be outside and 
        I love to ski.
